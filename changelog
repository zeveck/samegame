// Same Game
// Rich Conlan
//
// Based on Same Game by Ikuo Hirotaha, written for Windows 3.1,
// itself based on the MS DOS version by Eiji Fukumoto and Wataru Yoshioka.

// v1.0 -- August 04, 2012

Implements Same Game based on Windows 3.1 game of the same name.

// v1.1 -- August 04, 2012

Made it so that singleton blocks aren't killable (this is a dynamic from
the original game that was skipped in v1.0).

// v1.2 -- August 05, 2012
// http://www.embracetherandom.com/samegame/samegame_v1_2_src_bundle.zip

Made it so that the title block resizes slightly larger on mobile.
Made it so the attribution link wraps to the size of the board.
Made it so that the src link floats right.

// v1.3 -- August 13, 2012
// http://www.embracetherandom.com/samegame/samegame_v1_3_src_bundle.zip

Moved the screenshot out of the browser view instead of hidden behind the board.
Fixed animation bug in column slide so that they now slide at even speed even if multiple columns being removed.
Now previews the blocks to be removed and gives you the value of the removal; requires second click to actually remove.
